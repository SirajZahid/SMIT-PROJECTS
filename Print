9) Check if the income in dollars is a float or integer value. if it is float, re-write the code so that income gets converted in integer. print the income in integer type value

In [166]: #existing variables monthly_income_pkr=200000 conversion_rate = 278.25

#converting to dollar monthly_income_usd=monthly_income_pkr / conversion_rate

#checking if the value is float if isinstance(monthly_income_usd,float):

#Converting to integer
monthly_income_usd = int(monthly_income_usd) 
display value in int value

print(f"monthly income usd in int is {monthly_income_usd}") monthly income usd in int is 718 In [174]: weight_in_g=70600

weight_in_KG = int(weight_in_g / 1000)

print (f"weight is {weight_in_KG} KG .") weight is 70 KG . In [1]: #11) print the year of birth of Mr. Ahmed.

The year of birth of Mr. Ahmed is 1994 . 12) Can Rs. 100 be divided equally among 6 students? HINT: % operator (modulo)

In [3]: 10%2

10 is completely divisible by2

10 is multiple of 2

2 is a factor of 10

10 comes in table of 2

Out [3]: 0 In [180]: money=100

student =6

remainder = money % student

if remainder == 0: print("yes! it can be divided equally ") else : print("no! it can't") no! it can't In [ ]:
