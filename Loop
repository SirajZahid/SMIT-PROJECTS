In [34]:
first_term = 3
common_difference = 4

# Print the first 8 terms of the arithmetic progression

a = 2  # First term
r = 3  # Common ratio

# Number of terms to print
n = 6

# Loop to print the first 6 terms
for i in range(n):
    term = a * (r ** i)
    print(term)

11.. Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer value. The program shouldcalculate the sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number entered. For example, ifthe user enters 20, the loop will find the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 20.
In [42]:
number = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
if number <= 0:
    print("Please enter a positive integer.")
else:
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, number + 1):
        total_sum += i
    
    print(f"The sum of all integers from 1 to {number} is: {total_sum}")
Enter a positive integer:  120
The sum of all integers from 1 to 120 is: 7260
12. write a program that takes a positive integer N as input and calculates the sum ofthe reciprocals of all numbers from 1 up to N. The program should display the final sum.
In [45]:
N = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
if N <= 0:
    print("Please enter a positive integer.")
else:
    reciprocal_sum = 0.0
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        reciprocal_sum += 1 / i
    
    print(f"The sum of the reciprocals of numbers from 1 to {N} is: {reciprocal_sum}")
Enter a positive integer:  8
The sum of the reciprocals of numbers from 1 to 8 is: 2.7178571428571425
13. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number and repeats this process 5 times. The program should accumulate the numbers entered and then display the final running total.
In [48]:
# Initialize the running total variable
total = 0

# Repeat the process 5 times
for i in range(5):
    # Prompt the user to enter a number
    number = float(input(f"Enter number {i + 1}: "))
    
    # Add the entered number to the total
    total += number

# Display the final running total
print(f"The final running total is: {total}")
Enter number 1:  10
Enter number 2:  15
Enter number 3:  35
Enter number 4:  0
Enter number 5:  90
The final running total is: 150.0
14. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer and calculates its factorial. The factorial of a positive integer 'n' is denoted as 'n!' and is calculated by multiplying all the integers from 1 to 'n' together. For example, the factorial of 5(denoted as 5!) is calculated as 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5. The program should display the factorial value if the input is a positive number, or display a message stating that the factorial does not exist for negative numbers.Additionally, for an input of zero, the program should output that the factorial of 0 is 1.
In [52]:
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
number = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
if number < 0:
    print("Factorial does not exist for negative numbers.")
else:
    fact = factorial(number)
    print(f"The factorial of {number} is: {fact}")
Enter a positive integer:  22
The factorial of 22 is: 1124000727777607680000
15. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a base number and an exponent, and then calculates the power of the base to the exponent. The program should not use the exponentiation operator (**) or the math.pow() function. The program should handle both positive and negative exponents.
In [64]:
def power(base, exponent):
    result = 1
    if exponent > 0:
        for _ in range(exponent):
            result *= base
    elif exponent < 0:
        for _ in range(abs(exponent)):
            result *= base
        result = 1 / result
    elif exponent == 0:
        result = 1
    return result
base = float(input("Enter the base number: "))
exponent = int(input("Enter the exponent: "))
result = power(base, exponent)
print(f"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is: {result}")
Enter the base number:  2
Enter the exponent:  4
2.0 raised to the power of 4 is: 16.0
