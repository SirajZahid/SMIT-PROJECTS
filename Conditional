Write a program that prompts the user to enter their weight (in kilograms) and height

(in meters). The program should calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula:

BMI = weight / (height * height). The program should then classify the BMI into one of

the following categories:

less than 18.5 - Underweight

BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 - Normal weight

BMI between 25 and 29.9 - Overweight

BMI 30 or greater - Obesity

In [122]:
# Taking inputs from the user
weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kilograms: "))
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))

# Calculating BMI
bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

# Classifying BMI
if bmi < 18.5:
    category = "Underweight"
elif 18.5 <= bmi <= 24.9:
    category = "Normal weight"
elif 25 <= bmi <= 29.9:
    category = "Overweight"
else:
    category = "Obesity"

# Displaying the result
print(f"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}")
print(f"You are classified as: {category}")
Enter your weight in kilograms:  433
Enter your height in meters:  43343434
Your BMI is: 0.00
You are classified as: Underweight

print(f"The grade is: {grade}")
Enter the marks for subject 1:  43
Enter the marks for subject 2:  34
Enter the marks for subject 3:  34
The average mark is: 37.00
The grade is: F
9. The roots of the quadratic equation ax2
bx + c = 0, a â‰  0 are given by the following
formula:

In this formula, the term b2

4ac is called the discriminant. If b2

4ac = 0, then the

equation has two equal roots. If b2

4ac > 0, the equation has two real roots. If b2

4ac < 0, the equation has two

complex roots. Write a program that prompts the user to input the value of a (the coefficient of x2 ), b (the coefficient of x), and c (the constant term) and outputs the roots of the quadratic equation.

In [135]:
import math

# Taking inputs from the user
a = float(input("Enter the coefficient a: "))
b = float(input("Enter the coefficient b: "))
c = float(input("Enter the constant term c: "))

# Calculating the discriminant
discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c

# Checking the nature of the roots
if discriminant > 0:
    # Two real and distinct roots
    root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
    root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
    print(f"The roots are real and distinct: {root1} and {root2}")
elif discriminant == 0:
    # One real root (repeated)
    root = -b / (2*a)
    print(f"The root is real and repeated: {root}")
else:
    # Complex roots
    real_part = -b / (2*a)
    imaginary_part = math.sqrt(-discriminant) / (2*a)
    print(f"The roots are complex: {real_part} + {imaginary_part}i and {real_part} - {imaginary_part}i")
Enter the coefficient a:  232
Enter the coefficient b:  233
Enter the constant term c:  2323

# Taking inputs from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
num3 = float(input("Enter the third number: "))

# Creating a list of the numbers
numbers = [num1, num2, num3]

# Sorting the list in ascending order
numbers.sort()

# Printing the sorted numbers
print("The numbers in ascending order are:", numbers)
Enter the first number:  43

elif number_of_calls <= 150:
    bill = 200 + (number_of_calls - 100) * 0.60
elif number_of_calls <= 200:
    bill = 200 + 50 * 0.60 + (number_of_calls - 150) * 0.50
else:
    bill = 200 + 50 * 0.60 + 50 * 0.50 + (number_of_calls - 200) * 0.40

# Displaying the result
print(f"The monthly telephone bill is: Rs. {bill:.2f}")
Enter the number of calls:  2
The monthly telephone bill is: Rs. 200.00
