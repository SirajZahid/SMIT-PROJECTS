print("Unique List:", unique_list)  
9. Write a Python function that takes a number as a parameter and checks whether the number is prime or not.
Note : A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 and that
has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
In [ ]:
def is_prime(number):
    if number <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(number ** 0.5) + 1):

print(even_numbers)
11. Write a Python function to check whether a number is "Perfect" or not.According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum).Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself).
Example : The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive
divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of
all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 +
2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128.
In [ ]:
def is_perfect_number(n):
    """
    Check if a number is a perfect number.
    
    A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors
    (excluding itself).
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): The number to check.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if n is a perfect number, False otherwise.
    """

        return False  # No perfect numbers less than 2

    # Find all proper divisors of n
    proper_divisors = [i for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1) if n % i == 0]
    
    # Check if the sum of the divisors equals the number
    return sum(proper_divisors) == n

# Test the function
test_numbers = [6, 28, 496, 8128, 12, 97]
for num in test_numbers:
    print(f"{num} is a perfect number: {is_perfect_number(num)}")
12. Write a Python function that checks whether a passed string is a palindrome or not.
    Note: A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward
    as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.
In [ ]:
def is_palindrome(s):
    """
    Check if a given string is a palindrome.
    
    A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.
    
    Parameters:
    s (str): The string to check.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the string is a palindrome, False otherwise.
    """
    # Remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
    cleaned = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())
    
    # Check if the cleaned string is equal to its reverse
    return cleaned == cleaned[::-1]

# Test the function
test_strings = ["madam", "nurses run", "racecar", "hello", "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"]
for string in test_strings:
    print(f"'{string}' is a palindrome: {is_palindrome(string)}")
